#Why are these files here?

These files are various old versions--going back to 2016--meant to compute the similarity score, based on GO terms, between pairs of proteins. The first version was written on July 1st 2016.... and stopped working by the end of the month. The second one was written near the end of July... and worked for a few more months. Since that time, at least a few times a year, some student has had to update this script because _the code just keeps breaking even when I make no changes_.  This is just one example of Python codes written for me by my students that never work for more than a few months.

This experience led me to change my email signature to the below. I have yet to be proved wrong.

*Python is the fucking shittiest programming language in the history of mankind.*
I don't care how many libraries it has.
Code that works this week should run next year without problems.
Instead, Python code experiences "bit rot" and stops working on a timescale of weeks--even with a virtual environment,
even with a requirements.txt file, even on the same machine, even if that machine hasn't been rebooted in the meantime.
Even pip stops working if you wait long enough.
We're teaching this shit to our students as if it were normal to have such instability?!
Our seniors have spent 4 years learning this language and still can't figure out how to write Python code that
continues to work for more than a few months after it was written.
There is no nice way to say it: *this is fucking unacceptable*.

Note: this opinion is my personal opinion and does not represent that of my department,
university, or anybody else for that matter. If you found it offensive... prove me wrong by fixing, for example,
any of _these codes_ so that it'll run for at least a year, preferably a decade.
